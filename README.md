## Code of conduct

- **Pitch in!**, and offer what help you can, as there is never enough time to do everything. If you noticed that something is lacking in the documentation, you're probably right, so do generate as much issues as possible.
- Assume good intentions. English is the language of the team except for some situations, but, it is not every user's native language. Try to avoid too much slang, abbreviations, or idiomatic expressions.
- Keep it civil, courteous and polite. No personal attacks. 
- Don't waste people's time by generating unimportant issues.
- Please don't push files anywhere.
- For suggestions, please raise an issue.
- If you are a collaborator of this repository, please don't merge pull requests without confirmation from the owner.
